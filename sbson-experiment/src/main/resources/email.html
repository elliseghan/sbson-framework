Dear Sir/Madam,
 
<p>You are invited to participate in <b>A Survey on Managing the Impact of API Breaking Changes</b>. This survey is being conducted by the <a href="http://aseg.encs.concordia.ca">Ambient Software Engineering Group (ASEG)</a> from <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/">Concordia University</a> - Montreal, to study how developers and clients of Open Source Software (OSS) deal with API breaking changes. You are receiving this email because your contact information was publicly disclosed in a project hosted either on GitHub or the Apache Maven Repository.</p>
 
<p>The feedback collected from this survey will be used to better understand how and when OOS developers decide to introduce breaking changes, and how clients manage the direct and indirect impacts of such changes in their systems. Participation will take approximately 5-10 minutes; we appreciate your time to complete the survey.</p>
